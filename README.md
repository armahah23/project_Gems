# Auto Care Web Apllication
Revolutionizing Vehicle Care: Streamlining Service Centers with Automated Solutions



## 1. Project Overview

Vehicle service centers face difficulties in managing appointments, maintenance records, and inventory tracking, often resulting in inefficiencies due to manual scheduling. To       streamline operations and improve efficiency, we propose developing a web application specifically tailored for vehicle service centers, which will automate these processes         and enhance overall functionality.

## 2. Tech Stack

    Front-end: React.js
    Back-end: Node.js (Express)
    Database: MongoDB
    APIs: Google Maps API, Chatbot API (to be integrated later)

## 3. Tomorrowâ€™s Tasks

### 3.1 Back-end Designing

    Design the structure for the back-end API.
    Define key endpoints (e.g., /book-service, /view-appointments).
    Set up the basic folder structure (controllers, routes, models).
    Plan how to handle data (e.g., customer details, service records).

### 3.2 Front-end Recheck

    Review the existing front-end design.
    Fix any UI/UX issues or inconsistencies found.
    Ensure that the components are functioning as expected.

### 3.3 Prototype of Front-end UI Design

    Create a low-fidelity prototype of the front-end UI.
    Focus on layout, navigation, and user flow.
    Gather feedback from the team for improvement.

### 4. How to Add into Fork

    1. Fork the repository on GitHub (each member forks the project to their own account).

    2. Clone your fork to your local machine (download your fork to work on it locally).

    3. Set up the upstream repository to track changes from the original project (link your fork with the main project).

    4. Make changes in your local repository (modify files, add new features, etc.).

    5. Stage the changes (prepare the files you want to commit).

    6. Commit your changes with a clear message (explain what changes you made).

    7. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub (upload your changes).

    8. Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository (propose to merge your changes into the main project).

    9. Wait for review and merge (the team reviews your changes and merges them into the main project if approved).
    
## 5. How to Run the Project

    Clone the repository: git clone <repository-link>
    Install dependencies: npm install
    Run front-end: npm start (for React)
    Run back-end: npm run server (for Node.js)
