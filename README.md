# Auto Care Web Application
Revolutionizing Vehicle Care: Streamlining Service Centers with Automated Solutions






## 1. Project Overview

Vehicle service centers face difficulties in managing appointments, maintenance records, and inventory tracking, often resulting in inefficiencies due to manual scheduling. To       streamline operations and improve efficiency, we propose developing a web application specifically tailored for vehicle service centers, which will automate these processes         and enhance overall functionality.

## 2. AIM and Objectives 
### AIM: Revolutionize vehicle care by streamlining service centers through an innovative automated web application consisting cutting edge technology features.
### Objectives: 
* To implement an easy appointment booking system for Auto Care, so customers can book appointments quickly and reduce wait times.
* To introduce real-time reporting on Auto Care's website, allowing mechanics to update progress and generate bills, and owners to see performance data instantly.
* To provide a simple way to request emergency services through Auto Care's website for quick roadside help or towing.
* To set up an efficient inventory system for Auto Care to automatically update stock levels when parts are used.
* To enhance Auto Care's website with a ChatBot for customer support, Google Maps for easy location finding, and Google Translator for multiple languages.
* To improve the usability of Auto Care's website by automating tasks, making the interface easier to navigate, and adding features to increase customer satisfaction.


## 3. Tech Stack
* UI Design: Figma
* Front-end: React.js
* Back-end: Node.js (Express)
* Database: MongoDB
* APIs: Google Maps API, Chatbot API (to be integrated later)

<!-- These for only instruct the team -->
## This is for instruction about how to work in this repo as a team

### 3. How to Add into Fork

    1. Fork the repository on GitHub (each member forks the project to their own account).

    2. Clone your fork to your local machine (download your fork to work on it locally).

    3. Set up the upstream repository to track changes from the original project (link your fork with the main project).

    4. Make changes in your local repository (modify files, add new features, etc.).

    5. Stage the changes (prepare the files you want to commit).

    6. Commit your changes with a clear message (explain what changes you made).

    7. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub (upload your changes).

    8. Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository (propose to merge your changes into the main project).

    9. Wait for review and merge (the team reviews your changes and merges them into the main project if approved).
    
### 4. How to Run the Project

    Clone the repository: git clone <repository-link>
    Install dependencies: npm install
    Run front-end: npm start (for React)
    Run back-end: npm run server (for Node.js)

    

## Tomorrowâ€™s Tasks (9.9.24)

### 3.1 Back-end Designing

    Design the structure for the back-end API.
    Define key endpoints (e.g., /book-service, /view-appointments).
    Set up the basic folder structure (controllers, routes, models).
    Plan how to handle data (e.g., customer details, service records).

### 3.2 Front-end Recheck

    Review the existing front-end design.
    Fix any UI/UX issues or inconsistencies found.
    Ensure that the components are functioning as expected.

### 3.3 Prototype of Front-end UI Design

    Create a low-fidelity prototype of the front-end UI.
    Focus on layout, navigation, and user flow.
    Gather feedback from the team for improvement.
